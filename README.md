## Specs

Additional conditions:
- If you click on the row that shows "detailed" in the table to the right (the bottom of which shows detailed information about the job), you should close / open the panel with detailed information, and the line's light must also change depending on whether the panel is opened or closed.
- Do "search" in the search string like a placeholder.
- In the tree view on the left, it should be possible to select any element (not just "For execution"). Selecting an element is done by clicking anywhere on the rectangular area (and not just when you click on the text).
